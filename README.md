# master-thesis

This repository contains the code which was used in my master thesis.

The "analyzing" folder holds the scripts which were used for visualising the data.
The data was acquired with the code in the "data_acquisition" folder and
the features were calculated with the scripts in the "feature_acquisition" folder.
